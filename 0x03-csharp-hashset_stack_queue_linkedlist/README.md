# Tasks

## 0. Unique addition
Write a method that adds all unique integers in a list.

* Class Name: List
* Prototype: ```public static int Sum(List<int> myList)```
* Returns the sum of unique integers in given list

## 1. Present in both mandatory
Write a method that returns a sorted list of common elements in two lists.

* Class Name: ```List```
* Prototype: ```public static List<int> CommonElements(List<int> list1, List<int> list2)```
* Returns a new sorted list of common elements in two given lists
* You cannot use ```LINQ```
* You cannot use ```SortedList```

## 2. Only differents mandatory
Write a method that returns a sorted list of all elements present in one or the other list but not both.

* Class Name: ```List```
* Prototype: ```public static List<int> DifferentElements(List<int> list1, List<int> list2)```
* Returns a new sorted list of all elements present in one or the other list but not both of the given lists
* You cannot use ```LINQ```
* You cannot use ```SortedList```


## 3. Full stack mandatory
Given a ```Stack<string>```, write a program that does the following:

* Class: MyStack
* Prototype: ```public static Stack<string> Info(Stack<string> aStack, string newItem, string search)```
* Print the number of items in ```aStack```
    * Format: ```Number of items: <number>```
* Print the item at the top of ```aStack``` without removing it
    * Format: ```Top item: <item>```
    * If ```aStack``` is empty, print ```Stack is empty```
* Print if ```aStack``` contains a given item ```search```
    * Format: ```Stack contains <search>: <True / False>```
* If ```aStack``` contains the given item ```search```, remove all items up to and including ```search```; otherwise, leave ```aStack``` as is
    * You can use ```.Pop()``` only once
* Add a new given item ```newItem``` to ```aStack```
* Return ```aStack```

## 4. Queue it up mandatory
Given a ```Queue<string>```, write a program that does the following:

* Class: ```MyQueue```
* Prototype: ```public static Queue<string> Info(Queue<string> aQueue, string newItem, string search)```
* Print the number of items ```in aQueue```
    * Format: ```Number of items: <number>```
* Print the item at the top of ```aQueue``` without removing it
    * Format: ```First item: <item>```
    * If ```aQueue``` is empty, print ```Queue is empty```
* Add a new given item ```newItem``` to ```aQueue```
* Print if ```aQueue``` contains a given item ```search```
    * Format: ```Queue contains <search>: <True / False>```
* If ```aQueue``` contains the given item ```search```, remove all items up to and including ```search```; otherwise, leave ```aQueue``` as is
    * You can use ```.Dequeue()``` only once
* Return ```aQueue```

## 5. Print a LinkedList mandatory
Write a method that creates and prints a LinkedList of integers of a given size.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static LinkedList<int> CreatePrint(int size)```
* Returns the newly created list
* If ```size``` is negative, return an empty list

## 6. LinkedList length mandatory
Write a method that returns the number of elements in a LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static int Length(LinkedList<int> myLList)```
* Returns the number of elements in a given LinkedList
* You are not allowed to use ```.Count()```

## 7. Add node to the beginning mandatory
Write a method that adds a node to the beginning of a LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static LinkedListNode<int> Add(LinkedList<int> myLList, int n)```
* Returns the newly added node

## 8. Find value mandatory
Write a method that finds a value in a LinkedList and returns its index position in the list.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static int FindNode(LinkedList<int> myLList, int value)```
* Returns the index position of the first occurrence of the value given or ```-1``` if the value is not in the list
* You are not allowed to use ```.Find()``` or ```FindLast()```

## 9. Pop mandatory
Write a method that deletes the head node of a LinkedList and returns that node’s data.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static int Pop(LinkedList<int> myLList)```
* Returns the value of the head node
* If the list is empty, return ```0```

## 10. Get node at index mandatory
Write a method that returns the value of the nth node of a LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static int GetNode(LinkedList<int> myLList, int n)```
* Returns the value of the node at the given index
* If the node doesn’t exist, return ```0```
* Indexing starts at 0

## 11. LinkedList sum mandatory
Write a method that returns the sum of all the data of a LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static int Sum(LinkedList<int> myLList)```
* Returns the sum of the data in the LinkedList

## 12. Insert at index mandatory
Write a method that inserts a new node in the correct position in an ordered LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static LinkedListNode<int> Insert(LinkedList<int> myLList, int n)```
* Returns the newly created node

## 13. Delete at index mandatory
Write a method that deletes the node at given position in a LinkedList.

* Class Name: ```LList```
* Prototype: ```public static void Delete(LinkedList<int> myLList, int index)```
