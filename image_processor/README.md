# Tasks

## 0. Inverse 
In this project you will be creating an image processing console application that takes a list of images and creates new images from them based on the method.

For this task, create a method that inverts an image’s color.

## 1. Grayscale
Add a new method to the ImageProcessor class that converts each image to grayscale.

## 2. Black / White
Add a new method to the ImageProcessor class that reduces each image to only black and white values, based on a given threshold. 

## 3. Thumbnail 
Add a new method to the ImageProcessor class that creates a thumbnail image based on a given height (in pixels).
